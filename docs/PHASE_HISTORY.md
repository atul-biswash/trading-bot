# Phase History

What was built, and the reasoning that is not obvious from the code. Read this
when you need to know *why* something is shaped the way it is. `CLAUDE.md` holds
the rules; this holds the record.

---

## Phase 1 — Scaffolding

`config/` (settings + pydantic config models), `core/` (models, enums,
interfaces/ports, exceptions), `utils/` (logger, helpers), the strategy registry,
and test scaffolding.

`core/interfaces.py` defines the abstract ports every outer layer implements.
`Position` was scaffolded with `stop_loss`, `take_profit`, `trailing_stop`,
`highest_price` and `lowest_price` fields — the trailing-stop high-water mark
therefore already has a home, which is why the risk rules can stay pure.

---

## Phase 2 — Binance REST connectivity

- `exchange/models.py` — pure mappers plus `translate_binance_error`, which
  converts Binance error codes into the project's exception hierarchy.
- `exchange/base.py` — `BaseExchangeClient`: tenacity retry + error translation,
  **injectable sleep** (so retry logic is testable without real delay), and a
  symbol-info cache.
- `exchange/binance_client.py` — `BinanceClient` over `AsyncClient`, with
  `enforce_filters` and an async `create(settings)` factory.
- `scripts/check_testnet.py` — connectivity smoke check.

`_enforce` **raises** `OrderError` on `min_qty` / `min_notional` violations. That
raising behaviour is load-bearing for the risk layer's design (see Phase 5 M1).

---

## Phase 3 — Market data

**M1–M2** — `exchange/websocket_client.py` (`BinanceMarketDataStream`): a 24/7
closed-candle feed with a Protocol-based testability seam, capped-exponential
backoff with equal jitter, and per-handler exception isolation so one bad
subscriber cannot kill the stream.

**M3** — `data/market_data.py` (`BufferedMarketDataProvider`). Seeds
`DataConfig.history_limit` candles per pair over REST, then appends live closed
candles into a `deque(maxlen=buffer_size)`. A single append gate enforces
*closed candles only, strictly increasing `open_time`*. It **appends before it
notifies**, so a candle handed to a subscriber is already `buffer[-1]`.
`last_candle()` returns full-precision `Decimal`. This is the one deliberate
`Decimal`→`float` boundary in the system.

**M4** — `engine/live_engine.py` (`TradingEngine`): evaluates on bar close, one
strategy instance per pair, a readiness gate, and three isolation layers —
strategy exception contained → consecutive-failure quarantine at
`engine.max_strategy_errors` (any success resets the counter) → signal-handler
exceptions isolated. `on_signal()` is the seam where risk and execution attach.
`main.py` wires `python -m trading_bot run`.

---

## Phase 4 — Indicators and real strategies

**M1** — `indicators/indicators.py`: hand-written SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger,
ATR, plus public `true_range`. Pure functions, Series in → Series out. Warmup is
expressed as leading `NaN`, per function — never zero, never back-filled.

**M2** — `SmaCrossoverStrategy` and `RsiStrategy` became real. Edge-triggered,
stateless, `BUY`/`CLOSE` only, with `warmup_period` derived from the indicator
NaN contract (`slow+1`, `period+2`). `python -m trading_bot run` now emits real
signals on Testnet instead of quarantining every pair.

Port change: `generate_signal(symbol, candles, *, last_candle: Candle)` — the
strategy copies an exact `Decimal` instead of rebuilding one from the float
frame, and stamps `Signal.timestamp` from `candle.close_time`.

**M2 follow-ups** — the `Money` type began enforcing `Decimal` on all 33 money
fields (floats and `numpy.float64` now raise rather than coerce);
`SignalAction.HOLD` was removed; `StrategyConfigError` was added to name the
accepted parameters when `config.yaml` has a typo.

---

## Phase 5 M1 — Position sizing

`risk/position_sizing.py`: three pure functions plus an orchestrator.

```python
def size_by_fixed_fraction(*, equity, price, fraction) -> Decimal
def size_by_fixed_amount(*, price, amount) -> Decimal
def size_by_risk_per_trade(*, equity, entry_price, stop_price, risk_fraction) -> Decimal

def calculate_position_size(*, symbol_info, equity, price, sizing, limits,
                            stop_price=None) -> SizingDecision
```

Pipeline: **dispatch → cap at `max_position_size_percent` → round DOWN to
`step_size` → verify `min_qty` and `min_notional`.** The order matters — each
step can only reduce the previous one, which is what lets `SizingDecision` assert
`quantity <= requested_quantity`.

Decisions and their reasoning:

- **`float`→`Decimal` at config load, via pydantic.** Pydantic converts using the
  value's shortest repr, so YAML's `0.02` becomes `Decimal("0.02")`, not the
  binary expansion `Decimal(0.02)` gives. Rejected alternatives: converting at
  each use site (DRY violation, easy to forget) and a parallel "risk parameters"
  value object (permanent sync risk with the config model).
- **Rounding down, applied last.** Rounding up can overspend free balance.
  Applied after the cap so neither the configured size nor the cap can be
  exceeded by the rounding itself.
- **Filters applied in sizing.** `_enforce` raises, and "too small to trade" is
  routine on a small account — routing it through an exception would mean
  exception-as-control-flow on every signal. A raw untradeable quantity is also a
  lie in the domain: logs, notifications and the paper simulator would all
  display a number that cannot exist.
- **`SizingDecision` instead of `Decimal(0)` / `None` / raise.** A bare `None`
  loses the reason and forces the caller to re-derive it; `Decimal(0)` is
  silently carried forward by arithmetic. The wrapper makes zero safe because a
  caller cannot reach `.quantity` without seeing `.reason`. Validators enforce
  `quantity >= 0`, non-empty `reason`, and `quantity <= requested_quantity` —
  making "sizing never rounds up" a property of the type.
- **`strength` is unused, structurally.** The pure sizing functions never receive
  a `Signal`, so nothing can multiply a position size by it.
- **`equity` = total portfolio value in quote currency**, not free balance —
  otherwise position sizes shrink as capital deploys, which is not what "2% per
  trade" means. The caller must separately confirm free balance covers the order.

49 tests in `tests/unit/test_position_sizing.py`, exact `Decimal` assertions.

## Tooling cleanup milestone

The project had carried a "frozen baseline" of 17 mypy errors and 31 ruff
findings, verified by diffing finding *lists* rather than counts. That was
retired.

- **10 of the 17 mypy errors were false positives** — the pydantic mypy plugin
  was not enabled. Adding `plugins = ["pydantic.mypy"]` cleared all of them.
- **22 ruff findings were project-wide style decisions** (`UP017` `timezone.utc`,
  `UP042` `str, Enum`) and moved into `ignore` with their rationale written
  alongside. `N818` on `RiskLimitExceeded` got a *line-level* `noqa` instead of a
  global ignore, so the rule stays live for future exception classes.
- **The rest were genuine defects**, all small: redundant quoted annotations in
  `registry.py` (the file already had `from __future__ import annotations`), an
  `E402` where an import had drifted below a helper, a dead `noqa`, an unsorted
  `__all__`, `asyncio.TimeoutError`, and four missing annotations.

**Integration credential gate fixed.** The gate read `os.environ` directly, but
credentials live in `.env`, which pydantic-settings loads into `Secrets` at call
time and never exports to the environment. Three integration tests had therefore
been silently skipping since Phase 2 while reporting a specific, wrong reason.
`tests/integration/credentials.py` now asks `Secrets()`, and checks key *and*
secret as a pair. All three tests pass against the real Testnet.

**Line endings pinned.** The tree was a mix of CRLF and LF, which meant patches
authored on Linux failed byte-verification on Windows even when they applied
correctly. `.gitattributes` (`* text=auto eol=lf`) plus a one-time normalisation
of 29 files retired the old "preserve each file's existing line endings" rule.

Result: **373 passed · mypy 0 · ruff 0.**

## Known open items

- Tool versions are unpinned (`ruff>=0.3.0`, `mypy>=1.8.0`). Now that the gate
  reads a clean zero, a new release can break the build with no code change.
- `ruff format` is not a gate and ~16 files are formatter-dirty. Worth its own
  mechanical commit plus `ruff format --check` in `make check` — but check what
  it does to hand-laid tables inside `parametrize` first.
- The integration suite takes 1–2 minutes, dominated by the WebSocket test.
